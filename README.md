This is the experimental code of our paper, written by postgraduate student Mr. Yun Fan from NCUT, China.


We give a simple introduction for readers and reviewers to understand our work as below.


Our code implements a blockchain with a complete front end, which can visually view data link, block generation and log data search. The back-end implements a simple blockchain, and provides interfaces for the front-end such as uplink and query. Three block structures are designed to compare the query rate of the two schemes proposed by us and those proposed by other authors.
